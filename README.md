Notes for what will eventually become my research website.

Current threads:

- narrative ontologies of faculty roles in curric change
	- faculty roles are complex
	- multiple simultaneous conflicting ontologies are normal
	- curricular change is ontological

- curricular culture change
	- curriculum as culture / curriculum change as culture change
	- culture as layered (artifacts, values, assumptions)
	- top layer is observable; bottom layer is ontology (assumptions about reality)
	- ontologies materially influence the enactment of curriculum/engineering

- contradictory rhetoric
	- hey look, the humanities has things (rhet analys, pomo phil) we can use
	- including methodologies 'cos they're awesome
	- again, philosophies materially influence enactment

- SI stuff
	- miscodes are a thing
	- faculty aren't great at recognizing these miscodes; "expertise" must be preserved

- RC stuff
	- the hacker world is richly illustrative of many learning theories
	- it's socially constructed and communal
	- individually adaptable as feature, not bug
	- heavily gendered, classed, westernized, abled, etc.
	- andragogy, not pedagogy

- DGEER
	- "studying up"
	- flipping viewpoints: gain, not deficit
	- communal/collaborative work
	- visual/spatial skills
	- negotiation of meaning; social/evolving nature of language

Themes I am fascinated by:
	- the improvisational complexity of individual (adult) human formation in community
	- methods for challenging/disrupting our assumptions about reality
	- the justice/equity/surprise that can come about when we do
	- fundamental (re)conceptualizations of reality. now we see as in a mirror darkly...
